# Read-blockchain

Run the BlockchainReader class with parameter the directory on your local filesystem that contains (a part of) the bitcoin blockchain. It will read all "blk\*.dat" in that directory and returns a human-readable format for each block with transaction data.

The purpose of this script is to give people an efficient way to read the binary blockchain and use it to do analysis.
